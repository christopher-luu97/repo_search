# Repo Search with Natual Language QnA

## Demonstration Video:
[Coming Soon!]

## Description

This repository contains code to build a web application to search Python repositories and perform natural language question and answering on them! The main intent is to provide users with an interface for offline vector database that they can use to perform searches independently on a code base, without leaking data to the internet. The project utilises Marqo for the vector database, Django for the backend and React with Typescript on the frontend, styled with Tailwindcss.

## Purpose
Inspiration for this comes from wanting to search through code-bases easily and perform question and answering on them such as "What does this function do?" "Where else is this class referenced?". Specifically, this project aims to allow users a way to run the system locally, without needing to upload their data anywhere! This system is designed to be run offline, but also has the code provided such that users can lift-shift-transform on the code to their needs, their organizations needs or for client needs where IP is strongly protected!

## Features
- Natural language search functionality using Marqo open-source tensor-based search and analytics enging.
- [Insert LLM name here]
